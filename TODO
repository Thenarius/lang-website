========================================================================

[Scraps]
	- Limit Break: Like a Khan Academy "Mastery Challenge"; in order to be able to level up further, users are asked to go back and complete a test on all the material of a given unit (useful if they're leveling particular subskills and we need a way to test their overall ability)
	- The site should be usable to someone who does not have an account, although without saved progress. This makes it so that beta testers don't have as many hoops to go through in order to test out the site & get a feel for how it works for them.


[Old List]
- Work on grammar fluency pathways; research points of grammar that I am not sure on; devise flowchart based on grammatical prerequisites
- Work on profile screen
- Define a website structure with Myra, most likely; not set in stone, but a good idea of the way this should be organized.
- Note reading/writing/speaking/listening exercises (what kinds I want).
	- Work on ppts/flowcharts for the exercise flows so we can have a visual idea of the way exercises should work.
- Flesh out Lesson 1 for Japanese. Define a path of lesson skeletons so that we have example material - JLPT N4 & N5...
- Transcribe notes where needed.
- Get an idea for an actual design.
- Finish skeletons (listening).
- Generate more screens.
- Start considering backend.
- Write some JS skeletons, think more about genericization & randomization.
