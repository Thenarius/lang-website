TODO: 

Lesson Design
	Break JLPT level knowledge into "macrounits"; break those into subunits for teaching.

Website Design
	Implement Bootstrap-based design.

[Scraps]
	- Limit Break: Like a Khan Academy "Mastery Challenge"; in order to be able to level up further, users are asked to go back and complete a test on all the material of a given unit (useful if they're leveling particular subskills and we need a way to test their overall ability)


[Old List]
- Work on grammar fluency pathways; research points of grammar that I am not sure on; devise flowchart based on grammatical prerequisites
- Work on profile screen
- Define a website structure with Myra, most likely; not set in stone, but a good idea of the way this should be organized.
- Note reading/writing/speaking/listening exercises (what kinds I want).
	- Work on ppts/flowcharts for the exercise flows so we can have a visual idea of the way exercises should work.
- Flesh out Lesson 1 for Japanese. Define a path of lesson skeletons so that we have example material - JLPT N4 & N5...
- Transcribe notes where needed.
- Get an idea for an actual design.
- Finish skeletons (listening).
- Generate more screens.
- Start considering backend.
- Write some JS skeletons, think more about genericization & randomization.
