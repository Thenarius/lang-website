# 1.0 - Overview #

In this section, you'll be learning about how to describe the world around you -- a big task! But you'll be able to accomplish this through the use of a lot of little words & features. 

It's important to understand, if you've never taken a foreign language before, that different languages work differently. They have different ways of conveying the same thing. In Japanese, we express ourselves very differently than in English. If you want to express yourself clearly and like a native would, you'll want to get used to the Japanese way of doing things. We'll take a look at that as we go forwards. For right now, 頑張ってください (do your best!)

# 1.1 - The Japanese Writing System #

In Japanese, we use three different writing systems. Two of these are **syllabaries**, where one syllable corresponds to one written character. The Japanese syllabaries are called hiragana and katakana, and there are 46 of each.

Hiragana are the first characters children learn in Japan. For very young children, *everything* is written in hiragana. However, as they age, they move away from this, because writing written solely in hiragana is very hard to read. This is because Japanese is written without spaces. In most Japanese writing, kanji serve to break up the text into chunks the way spaces do in English. The kanji represent the roots of words, and what remains is written in hiragana: mainly grammatical information such as verb endings and particles. But if you don't know how to write a given kanji, you can always use hiragana. Plus, some words are never written with kanji, like こんにちは ("hello"). (If you used the kanji for こんにちは, you'd have 今日, a different word entirely ("today")!)

Katakana are a different beast. The katakana look markedly different from hiragana: sharp and angular where hiragana are round and loopy. Because of this, sometimes people use them to make words stand out in advertisements and other text like that. Their main usage, however, is to write foreign words and names, like アメリカ ("America"). If you don't have a Japanese name, you will write yours in katakana, too. You can see what it would look like (http://www.sljfaq.org/cgi/e2k.cgi)[here].

The syllabaries cover two out of three writing systems, but what about the third? We touched on kanji a little bit above, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in-depth later on. But for right now, all you need to know about kanji is that they are a logographic script that the Japanese borrowed from China to write their language with. *Logographic* means that each character represents one word or phrase or other meaning. Kanji don't represent sound, but ideas. They're also far more complex than hiragana or kanji; kanji are made up of different picture-components, called *radicals*, arranged together to make one big picture, or *character*. Radicals can contribute sound or meaning to the overall kanji. They're also an excellent way to remember how to write the character, which can be a tricky endeavor. You also use radicals to look kanji up in a dictionary, which you'll probably do quite often: over 2,000 kanji are commonly used in Japanese, and the definitive dictionary of kanji lists over 50,000.

We'll take a closer look at each of these characters in the next few subsections. By the end of this section, you'll know how to read and write the hiragana and katakana, as well as some simple kanji. Take it slowly as you go; give ample practice to the hiragana and katakana to let them sink in. When you're ready to read and write Japanese, you can move on to the next section and start in on Japanese grammar.

#### Sidebar ####
Japanese can be written in several different ways. Today online, it is normally written like English: left-to-right then top-to-bottom. However, Japanese *books* (including manga, or graphic novels) are read from right-to-left, despite the order of the text on the page. This is because Japanese is traditionally written from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, like so: [Figure 1.1] It's a good thing to get used to reading both styles of writing.

### 1.1.1 - Hiragana ###

As mentioned before, the hiragana are the basic writing system of Japanese. You can write anything in hiragana if you don't know the kanji for it, and you must write particles and other grammatical pieces in hiragana.

There are 46 hiragana in use today, along with a few that only hold historical importance now. We'll focus on the 46 we need to read and write. Since hiragana (and katakana) are syllabaries, they're organized based on the vowel that a given "syllable" (kana) ends with: *a, i, u, e,* or *o*. A table of the hiragana is pictured below.

[Table 1.1: Hiragana]

Each hiragana has a *stroke order*. The stroke order is the way in which you physically write the character. When you do handwriting practice on [LW], the stroke order will be given for you to copy from.

The 46 base hiragana don't represent every sound in Japanese. In order to get those sounds, we use two tools: *dakuten/handakuten* and *youon*. **Dakuten** are little marks like this: ゛ that represent that a consonant is **voiced**. A voiced consonant is a version of another consonant made with an extra vibration of your vocal cords, like *k* and *g*, or *s* and *z*. Adding dakuten to the hiragana for *ka*, for instance, makes *ga*. **Handakuten** are similar to dakuten, but are used specifically with the hiragana for sounds beginning with *h-*: *ha*, *hi*, *hu*, *he*, and *ho*. Adding dakuten to these sounds yields *ba*, etc.; adding handakuten to them instead yields *pa*, *pi*, *pu*, *pe* and *po*. Not all hiragana can "take" dakuten, but only those for which it makes phonological sense. Pictured below is a table with the sounds made by adding dakuten and handakuten to other hiragana.

[Table 1.2 - Dakuten & Handakuten]

**Youon** are Japanese *diphthongs* (a sound made up of two vowel sounds), created by adding a *y* sound to a syllable ending in *i*. Youon are written with small versions of the hiragana *ya*, *yu* and *yo* (ゃ,　ゅ, and ょ). For example, to write the word "today" (kyou), we add *chiisai yo* ("small yo") to the *ki* hiragana, then add *u*: *きょう*. A table of youon is below. 

[Table 1.3 - Youon]

Finally, there is one more way to show a sound that does not use hiragana: *chiisai tsu* (small 'tsu'). Like the small ya, yo, and yu used to write *youon*, small tsu is just a small form of the hiragana tsu: っ. It's placed before a consonant to show that that consonant is doubled. For instance, the word いってきます is read "ittekimasu", with the doubled "t" in "te" because of the small tsu preceding it.

Now that you can read hiragana, you know everything you need to read small children's books written in Japanese. Head over to the practice section to get some practice decoding hiragana, and take your first steps in reading real Japanese.

### SIDEBAR ###

If you've never heard about voiced and voiceless consonants before, there's an easy way to feel the difference. 

First, lightly place your fingertips on your throat. No need to press hard; please don't hurt yourself!

Next, start making the sound of a voiceless consonant, like *k* or *s* or *f* or *t*. Make it a few times. Get familiar with the feeling.

Now, start making the sound of that consonant's voiced partner: *g* or *z* or *v* or *d*. Keep going. Do you feel the difference? Can you feel the vibration in your throat? Voiced consonants are identical to their voiceless counterparts, with the exception of the vocal cords. Your vocal cords vibrate when you make a voiced sound, hence the name "voiced". If you can remember which consonants are "paired" like this, then you'll find it trivial to remember which kana to add *dakuten* to to make the sound you want.

### 1.2 - Katakana ###

As we discussed before, the katakana are the second syllabary of written Japanese, used to write foreign words and names, as well as to visually distinguish a portion of text. Below is a table of the katakana.

[Table 1.4 - Katakana]

Like hiragana, we use dakuten, handakuten, and little ya/yu/yo to represent all sounds in Japanese. We also can use dakuten with a few different sounds than in the hiragana, in order to properly represent more foreign sounds. In katakana, we use little forms of the five vowels *a, i, u, e,* and *o* just like we would use little ya/yu/yo to make more sounds possible. For example, we can represent the sound *fa* by using the katakana *fu* with *chiisai a*: ファ. The French name *Raphaël*　is written this way: ラファエル. Underneath, you can see a table with all of these sounds.

[Table 1.5 - Katakana with Dakuten & Handakuten; Youon; and foreign sounds]

Also like hiragana, we use *chiisai tsu* (ッ) to double a consonant in katakana. We also use one feature that hiragana does not normally use: a long dash (ー) to represent the elongation of a vowel. For example, the Japanese word for Australia (オーストラリア) uses one of these dashes, and is read "OOSUTORARIA". (Also, words in katakana are sometimes represented in ALL-CAPS when romanized. It's just convention, but it also helps bring over the effect that katakana have of "standing out" in a longer passage of Japanese.)

Now that you know how to read and write katakana, practice it by trying to write some names and words in English using katakana. Better yet, head over to the practice section, where we have an exercise designed just for that.
