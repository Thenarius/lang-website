I benefit most, in my own study, from the following:

- Previewing the material in advance in order to get an understanding of the context of what I'm studying, and how it all fits together.

- Having a multitude of methods to practice the material with; this aids consistency by letting me turn, for example, to practice exercises or lecture videos when I've grown tired of taking notes on my textbook.


Point #1 is accomplished by writing clear learning objectives that learners see before they begin a module, and to which they can refer as they read. Clear headings and structure of material will also help.

Point #2 is accomplished by offering this same multitude of methods to learners: written material, lecture videos expanding on this material, practice exercises (hand-writing, fill-ins, multiple-choice), quizzes & tests, flash cards (to make and review), games and conversation with other users all help the student learn and reinforce the material.
